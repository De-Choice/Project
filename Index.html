            The moment man sinned, he lost his identity in God and became alien to God. All that he used to enjoy in God<br>
            including the presence of God became something he didn't want to have again because he was now a stranger to<br>
            God (Gen 3:10). The being that God says should have dominion now becomes fearful because of sin. and we see<br> 
            God making attempts to restore that initial relationship with man all to no avail. Part of the attempts of God
            was<br> animal blood used as sacrifices for sin but that could still not make a man free from sin. Until this 
            prophecy by<br> Isaiah became fulfilled in Jesus. Jesus came and broke every limitation between us and God by his
            death on the<br> cross. By His death, we became acceptable to God. All that Jesus suffered was not because He was 
            a sinner. All<br> the mockery, pain, humiliation He suffered was as a result of him taking upon Himself our iniquities.
            Christ was<br> obedient to the father even till death. How obedient are we to Him who took our place and died so that
            we can live.<br> As we honour and remember all these that Jesus went through, let's examine our lives and answer this
            question within <br>us. Is Jesus' death not or becoming a waste over my life?
